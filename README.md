Terraform provisions the CCE cluster, node pools (native auto-scaling), networking, and IAM delegation. Once the cluster is ready, Flux v2 continuously reconciles the cluster state declared in `k8s-config/` against production. Infrastructure and GitOps content are decoupled and can be iterated independently.
